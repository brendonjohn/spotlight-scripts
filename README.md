# spotlight-scripts

A collection of bash scripts (3) that can be run via the spotlight search on Mac OS. This is meant to be small tweaks that make my life on MacOS a little bit better.


## Why bother?

I listen to music with Spotify. The keyboard i use doesn't have a pause, play or next button, so I've made a couple simple scripts that can be run from the Terminal or Spotlight Search (âŒ˜ + space)
